# Introduction
In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Launch on EC2 GPU Instance with udacity-aind AMI
* Follow Steps 1 to 10 in instructions_launch_ec2_gpu_instance.pdf
* Follow Step 11 in instructions_launch_ec2_gpu_instance.pdf to Login with:
	```
	ssh aind2@X.X.X.X
	```
* Follow Step 12 on EC2 GPU instance. Ensure correct Python kernel version in Jupyter https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30492623/using-both-python-2-x-and-python-3-x-in-ipython-notebook
	```
	git clone https://github.com/udacity/aind2-nlp-capstone
	cd aind2-nlp-capstone
	conda create --name aind-nlp-capstone python=3.5 numpy ipykernel
	conda install notebook ipykernel
	ipython kernel install --user
	source activate aind-nlp-capstone
	pip install tensorflow-gpu -U
	pip install keras -U
	KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser
	```
	* Open in browser the URL shown in terminal and replace IP address
